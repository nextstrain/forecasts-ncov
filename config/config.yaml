# A mapping between nextstrain clades, defining pango lineages and clade colours.
# Colours will be assigned to pango lineages by first associating it with its
# corresponding nextstrain clade and then interpolating colours close to the
# clade's colour; this allows each individual lineage to have its own colour
# whilst being able to visually associate them back to their nextstrain clade.
#
# The order in the list must be hierarchical w.r.t pango lineages, i.e. XBB.1.9
# must appear _before_ XBB
#
# NOTES:
# * Lineages are ordered (in the legend & for the GA estimates) alphabetically
#   via their full pango name. This doesn't map nicely onto nextstrain clade
#   definitions, which is why an individual colour scale defined here may appear
#   in multiple parts of the graph.
# * Lineages which are not a descendant of a clade-defining lineage will be
#   grouped as 'other'
